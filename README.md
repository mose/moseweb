mose custom jekyll setup
================

This is the jekyll source for https://mose.github.io and it's separate because it uses custom plugins for slim processing, and some nifty trick for language detection.

The layout can be of some interest to people, feel free to copy things, of course the resume content belongs to me but you can steal the css, js, html.


Howto
-----

    bundle exec foreman start

    # publish to update mose.github.io
    # upload to update mose.com
    rake publish upload
